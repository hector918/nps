# assets that ship with it. The service unit, its flags and any conf/ file are
# left exactly as they are, so a node started with -config= and a node started
# with bare flags need no special handling.
#
# Every release carries this script as an asset, which is where the command
# above takes it from. Never fetch it from master: piping it to a root shell
# hands every node to whoever can write to the branch it came from.
